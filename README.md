# win-retro-term

A cool terminal emulator for Windows which mimics the visual of old computers screen, this project is strongly inspired by the awesome [**cool-retro-term by Swordfish90**](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term).

It use ConPTY for the pseudo-console, the UI is made with WinUI 3 and the terminal is rendered using a DX11 swap chain associated with a SwapChainPanel in the UI.

It should work on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
